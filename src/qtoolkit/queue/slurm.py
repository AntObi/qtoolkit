# States in Slurm from squeue's manual. We currently only take the most important ones.
#     JOB STATE CODES
#        Jobs  typically pass through several states in the course of their execution.
#        The typical states are PENDING, RUNNING, SUSPENDED, COMPLETING, and COMPLETED.
#        An explanation of each state follows.
#
#        BF  BOOT_FAIL       Job terminated due to launch failure, typically due to a
#                            hardware failure (e.g. unable  to
#                            boot the node or block and the job can not be requeued).
#
#        CA  CANCELLED       Job  was explicitly cancelled by the user or system
#                            administrator.  The job may or may not
#                            have been initiated.
#
#        CD  COMPLETED       Job has terminated all processes on all nodes with
#                            an exit code of zero.
#
#        CF  CONFIGURING     Job has been allocated resources, but are waiting for
#                            them to become ready for  use  (e.g. booting).
#
#        CG  COMPLETING      Job is in the process of completing.
#                            Some processes on some nodes may still be active.
#
#        DL  DEADLINE        Job terminated on deadline.
#
#        F   FAILED          Job terminated with non-zero exit code or other
#                            failure condition.
#
#        NF  NODE_FAIL       Job terminated due to failure of one or more
#                            allocated nodes.
#
#        OOM OUT_OF_MEMORY   Job experienced out of memory error.
#
#        PD  PENDING         Job is awaiting resource allocation.
#
#        PR  PREEMPTED       Job terminated due to preemption.
#
#        R   RUNNING         Job currently has an allocation.
#
#        RD  RESV_DEL_HOLD   Job is being held after requested reservation was deleted.
#
#        RF  REQUEUE_FED     Job is being requeued by a federation.
#
#        RH  REQUEUE_HOLD    Held job is being requeued.
#
#        RQ  REQUEUED        Completing job is being requeued.
#
#        RS  RESIZING        Job is about to change size.
#
#        RV  REVOKED         Sibling was removed from cluster due to other cluster
#                            starting the job.
#
#        SI  SIGNALING       Job is being signaled.
#
#        SE  SPECIAL_EXIT    The job was requeued in a special state. This state
#                            can be set by users, typically in Epi‚Äê
#                            logSlurmctld, if the job has terminated with a particular
#                            exit value.
#
#        SO  STAGE_OUT       Job is staging out files.
#
#        ST  STOPPED         Job has an allocation, but execution has been stopped
#                            with SIGSTOP signal. CPUS have been retained by this job.
#
#        S   SUSPENDED       Job  has  an  allocation, but execution has been
#                            suspended and CPUs have been released for other jobs.
#
#        TO  TIMEOUT         Job terminated upon reaching its time limit.
